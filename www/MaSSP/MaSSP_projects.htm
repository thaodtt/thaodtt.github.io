<h2> Math projects</h2>

<p> 1. The game of Set
	Description: To answer a few interesting questions regarding the game of Set. The game of Set is played as followed: 
there are many cards, each has one of three types of shape, number, color and shading. A Set consists of three cards in which each attribute is 
either the same on all three cards or is different on each of the three cards. Each time twelve cards are placed face up on the table. The players look for Sets, 
and whoever with the most Sets at the end of the game wins. There are a few interesting questions: how many cards are there? What is the probability to pick 
3 cards from the whole deck that form a Set? What is the maximum number of Sets possible among 12 given cards? What is the maximum number of cards in a Set-less pile?
</p>

<p> 2. Tossing the coin
	Description: Tossing a fair coin N times and record the H-T sequence (H=head, T=tail), 
we can ask many interesting questions about this sequence: What is the probability that we see some pattern (say HH) before 
some other pattern? How many times we expect to toss before seeing a certain pattern? What is the probability of getting a certain pattern given 
another pattern appears? What if we use an unfair coin instead?
</p>

<p> 3. Probabilistic number theory
	Description: What is the probability that a positive integer picked at random is a perfect square? or a prime? or has no square factor? What is the probability that two positive integers picked at random have no common factor? 
We will introduce to students some interesting results in analytic number theory such as the prime number theorem.</p>

<h2> Computer science projects</h2>

<p>Project name:  Creative Computing with Scratch

<br> 
<br>
<p>Description:
Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy to create interactive art, stories, simulations, and games - and share those creations online. In this project, students will learn how to create their own Scratch projects, through which they will become familiar with basic programming concepts. No previous experience with programming is required. Goals: Students become familiar with the computational thinking concepts of variables, logic blocks, loops, events and with communication skills, such as brainstorm ideas, give critical feedback, and deliver presentations effectively
