My current research interests are in Extremal Combinatorics, Discrete Geometry, Probabilistic and Polynomial Methods in Combinatorics and applications of Combinatorics in other fields. My work so far has been focused on Incidence Geometry, the study of incidences between points and geometric sets in some spaces, and semi-algebraic graphs (hypergraphs), the ones where vertices are points in some Euclidean spaces and the edges (hyperedges) are defined by some semi-algebraic relations.

<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<small>Given m points and n hyperplanes in R^d, if there are too many incidences, we expect to find a big cluster K_{r,s} in their incidence graph. Apfelbaum and Sharir found lower and upper bounds for the largest size of rs, which only match in 3 dimensions. In this paper we close the gap in 4 and 5 dimensions. </small>

<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<small>Given a set of m points in R^d and some positive beta less than 1, a sphere in R^d is called beta-nondegenerate if none of its proper subspheres contains more than beta of the total number of points. In this paper, we find an upper bound on the number of incidences between points and beta-nondegenerate spheres in four dimensions, which results in an improved upper bound for the number of similar triangles formed by n points in R^4. </small>

<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<small>We derive a general upper bound for the number of incidences with k-dim varieties in R^d where the leading term generalizes previous bounds for the special cases of k=1, k=d-1, and k= d/2. Moreover, we find lower bounds showing that this leading term is tight (up to sub-polynomial factors) in various cases. This partially resolves a conjecture in this <a href="https://adamsheffer.wordpress.com/2017/07/19/incidences-in-higher-dimensions-a-conjecture/"> blog post</a>. We also find tight bounds for incidences with hyperplanes in complex spaces. </small>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<small>Given a bipartite graph, its representation complexity is the size of the most compact way to cover the graph by complete bipartite subgraphs. In this paper we derive an upper bound for the representation complexity of semi-algebraic graphs, which, in certain ranges, implies a stronger bound for the Zarankiewicz's problem for semi-algebraic graphs.</small>

<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<small>Zarankiewicz's problem asks for the largest possible number of edges in a graph that does not contain a fixed complete bipartite subgraph. Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Sulk and Zahl show that a bound better than the classical ones exists if the graph is semi-algebraic. In this paper, we extend their method to hypergraphs, which has applications to the unit minor and unit volume simplices problems.</small></div>

<small> Erd&#337s-Beck's theorem states that n points in the plane with at most n-x points collinear define at least cxn lines for some positive constant c. In this paper we present two ways to extend this result to higher dimensions.</small></div>

<small> 
The k-planar local crossing number of a graph G is the minimum positive integer L such that G can be decomposed into k subgraphs, each of which can be drawn in a plane such that no edge is crossed more than L times. In this note, we show that under certain natural restrictions, the ratio between the k-planar local crossing number and the local crossing number is of order 1/k^2, which is analogous to a recent result of Pach et al. for the k-planar crossing number.</small></div>

<small>
It is known that any positive integer can be represented uniquely as a sum and difference of Fibonacci numbers such that any two adjacent summands of the same sign must be at least 4 indices apart and those of opposite signs must be at least 3 indices apart. In this paper we extend this to other sequences. </small></div>

Given a subset A of {1,...,n} with density p, pick a set B by the following rule: a is in B with prob p_1 if a is in A, and prob p_2 otherwise for some fixed p,p_1,p_2 in (0,1). We show that there is a positive proportion of such (A,B) such that the size of their sumset is larger than the size of their difference set. </small></div>

We solve the functional equation f o p = f o q where f is a rational function, p,q are meromorphic functions, and the numerator of (f(x)-f(y))/(x-y) is irreducible. This resolves a question of Lyubich and Minsky on laminations in holomorphic dynamics, and also solves a problem arising from a generalization of Nevanlinna's result that meromorphic functions are determined by their preimages at five points</small></div>

<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
<small>
Given a branched cover p: S' -> S beteween closed orientable surfaces, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula relates the Euler characteristics of S, S', the total degree d of p, the number n of branch points in S and the sum of the lengths of the partitions (d_i) of d given by the local degrees of p at the preimages of the branch points. The Hurwitz existence problem asks whether a given combinatorial datum (d,n,(d_i)) satisfying the Riemann-Hurwitz formula is actually realized by a branched cover. We introduce a new obstruction to such realizability, which explains over 99% of the non-realizable data of degree at most 22. </small></div>
